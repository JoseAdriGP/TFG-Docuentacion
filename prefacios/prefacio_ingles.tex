	At present, a wide variety of studies and works related to the concept of immersion can be observed, seeking to facilitate the assimilation by users of the information that the program, therapy, study... provide.
	To this end, this project is preparing to investigate the integration into virtual reality of the 8D sound algorithms to improve user immersion in a virtual environment.
	The work presented has been assembled in unity, developing it as an application in android.
	The user's interactions with the virtual environment only require the application, a mobile with a cardbord and a stereo headset.
